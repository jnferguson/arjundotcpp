C++ port of s0md3v's Arjun
Presently a "worked for me" initial commit with only minor variances in behavior from s0md3v's official version.

s0md3v describes Arjun as a "HTTP Parameter Discovery Suite"; it basically performs basic hueristics on returned webpages and tries to brute force detect hidden/unknown parameters.
